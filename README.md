### This is my solution to John Crickett's [build your own wc coding challenge](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/).

#### You can run a test suite that compares the system's default `wc` output with my implementation with:
```bash 
./run_tests.sh
``` 

#### To use the program, do: 

```bash 
lua wc.lua -flag <filename>
```
