### An implementation of `wc` 

This is my approach designing a Lua implementation of 
the `wc` command from Unix-like OSs. 

To use it: 

```bash 
lua main.lua -flag <filename>
```

You can test the output of this implementation 
with the original `wc` by running the following script:

```bash 
./verify.sh
```
